# Linear-combinations-of-composition-methods
Coefficients for the article "Linear combinations of composition methods".

The file `loader.pyÂ´ loads all coefficients into named variables and prints one of the sets of coefficents. Comments explain the corresponding integrators and figures in the paper. One may print the coefficients via editing the last code snippet

```python
print('Coefficents for Fig. 4, 5-stage integrator')
print(f'a1={a_ord8_91[:,0]}')
print(f'a2={a_ord8_91[:,1]}')
print(f'b={b_ord8_91}')
```
to print a different set of coefficients such as
```python
print('Coefficents for Fig. 1, k=2 integrator')
print(f'a={a_ord4_k2}')
print(f'b={b_ord4_k2}')
```
